# Star Wars Memory Game
Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project 

This project was design to show my skills using Javascript and make the user interact with the webpage. 
A memory game was made for many benefits that it can bring to the users.
It has been proven that memory games help to enhance other brain functions and it stimulates peoples mind. Besides this exercise increases short memory and improves creativity.



## User eXperience Project
As a student of Software Development I want to show my abilities with Javascript and make users experience a page with a interactive frontend development in a fun way.
And apart from th

## Strategy

My strategy was to keep the game simple but funcitonal and fun. More fucntions were added in order to make the game more exciting such as "best score".


## Structure

[Skeleton - wireframe](https://github.com/Pauloa90/Memory-Game---Star-Wars/blob/master/assets/images/wireframes/wireframe2.jpeg) <br/>



## Skeleton
The webpage is a single section with 3 minors div inside the body in the html file.

### Info Game
This section provides information about the game such as time, flips and score. I also added a button "instructions" as good practses.

### Container
In this section all cards will be displayed accordingly. This division makes the way of displaying the cards better and more organized.
In this area the user will click the card in order to flip them.

### Links
Here the user will have acess to my LinkedIn, GitHub and a form to contact through icons displayed inder the container with the cards.

## Surface
Having StarWars as the theme of the memory game a image of the galaxy was set as a background occupiyng 100% of the user's screen.
Colors such purple white and black connects the user to the subject chosen. Also if the user hover over the card a shadow box will appear with the color of the lightsaber green from the movies.
HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript were users in order to bring this project to ligth.
No Navbar was needed as it is a single section page.
Over the icon links (GitHub, LinkedIn and Contact) the user will see the opcacity changing and giving more motion to the page.


## Testing




Prospective clients trying to find a good personal trainer in Dublin will access the site through Internet search engines.
First, they will see a navigation bar at the top, where you can take them to any section of the site, and below a 
carousel with photos and statements of Ivan, inviting customers to contact Ivan. I decided to keep the navigation bar 
fixed at the top of the web page to make it easier for users to change the section. Three photos were selected to slide 
on the carousel. To keep photos looking good, when placed at a smaller size, a "div" with a button will appear, taking up
50% of the screen on mobile phones, making photos look good and giving customers a button to access the form.

The site is a page of 4 sections on a scrolling page. Second, below the carousel, an "about me" section will 
appear saying little about Ivan and his missions, giving the web page credibility. This section has been divided 
into two parts, where one part of Ivan's photo will participate and the text the other. On small screens, each section 
of these two will occupy 100% of the screen to keep it looking good and also keep the text visually well placed.

The third section called “Set Your Goal”, customers who are confused about what to do, what type of exercise they need 
to perform, cards will appear explaining some of each methodology. Cards are also a link that leads them to a video 
with related content on YouTube. Note that Ivan doesn't have these videos yet. When he does, the videos will be replaced.
The videos will open in a new tab using "target = 'blank'" to keep potential customers in a strategic position and keep 
track of our site. All links have been tested, they are working perfectly.


To ensure that the site is responsive, the site has been tested on various browsers such as Chrome, Safari,
and Internet Explore, and to ensure that it works on mobile, the site has been tested in the "inspection" sections 
of the Chrome browser.

## Deployment
In order to keep the file updated correctly every time that it is committed, the name of the HTML file is index.html. This site is hosted using GitHub pages built from master Branch.

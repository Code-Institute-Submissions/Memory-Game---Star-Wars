# Star Wars Memory Game
Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project 


This project was developed to show my skills using Javascript and make the user interact with the web page.
A memory game has been created for many benefits that it can bring to users.
Memory games have been proven to help improve other brain functions and stimulate people's minds. In addition, it exercises and increases short memory and improves creativity.


## User eXperience Project
As a software development student, I want to showcase my Javascript skills and get users to experience a page with interactive front-end development in a fun way.


## Demo

Please check the link to see a screenshot of each section.

## Strategy

My strategy was to keep the game simple, but functional and fun. More functions have been added to make the game more exciting, such as "best score", a flips counter and a timer.

## Structure

[Skeleton - wireframe](https://github.com/Pauloa90/Memory-Game---Star-Wars/blob/master/assets/images/wireframes/wireframe2.jpeg) <br/>



## Skeleton
The web page is a single section with 3 smaller divs inside the body in the html file.

### Info Game
This section provides information about the game, such as time, flips and scores. I also added an "instructions" button as good practice.

### Container
In this section, all cards will be displayed accordingly. This division makes the way of displaying the cards better and more organized.
In this area, the user will click on the cards to flip them.

### Links
Here, the user will have access to my LinkedIn, GitHub and a form to contact me through three icons displayed just below the container with the cards.

## Surface
With StarWars as the theme of the memory game, an image of the galaxy was set as the background occupying 100% of the user's screen.
Colors such as white, purple and black connect the user to the chosen subject. In addition, if the user hovers the mouse over the card, a shadow box will appear with the green lightsaber color of the films.
The technologies used to implement the game were HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript were used in order to bring this project to light.

Navbar was not required as it is a single section page.
On the icon links (GitHub, LinkedIn and Contact), the user will see the opacity changing and giving more movement to the page.


## Testing
Users that want to try a fun game using Javascript can acess my page on GitHub. The timer will start as soon as the page is loaded.
The user can refresh the page if they wish to reset the timer so. Every time that the user clicks on a card the number of flips will increase by one.
A button with the instructions to play is presented on the right side. If clicked a modal will pop up the instructions of how to play.
 If the player has played once, the button will disappear.
The reason why is that is undestood that the player know how to play already.

The best score will be shown. A comparative will be made on Javascript and just the highiest number will appear in order to keep the player motivateded to beat their own score.
When the user hovers over a card, a shadow with lightgreen will appear around the cards. That will bring the StarWards identity to the gamme.
Also in order to do it so the face of the cards are StarWars characters.

The user will chose two cards, if they match they will remain with the face up.
When the plaer finishes all the 8 cards a modal will pop ul with a message and their score.
The logic behind the score is: Number of Macthes(8 if the player finishes the game) x 30/ Time x Flips.
Also a button "Play again" will appear on this modal and when clicked the cards will shuffle and time counter of flips and the timer will reset.



## Deployment
In order to keep the file updated correctly every time that it is committed, the name of the HTML file is index.html. 
This site is hosted using GitHub pages built from master Branch.
